## Acknowledgements
The images here are meant to be used with the data tables available at [data.galaxyzoo](data.galaxyzoo.org). They are the "original" sample of subject images in Galaxy Zoo 2 (Willett et al. 2013, MNRAS, 435, 2835, DOI: [10.1093/mnras/stt1458](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stt1458)) as identified in Table 1 of Willett et al. and also in Hart et al. (2016, MNRAS, 461, 3663, DOI: [10.1093/mnras/stw1588](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stw1588)). The original GZ2 subjects also gave the option to view an inverted version of the subject image; these inverted images are not provided but are easily reproducible from the included subject images.
